# Development mode

See the [git workflow](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/doc/collabo-guidelines/contributing#git-workflow) section of the contribution guidelines page for how to set up project locally, and branching and other instructions. The sections below show how to run the node-mongo projects in development.

## node-mongo CLI

The commands to run when developing the [node-mongo-cli](https://github.com/code-collabo/node-mongo-cli) are the same as what is on the [node-mongo CLI page](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/node-mongo/) for users. The installation however is different. 

Install dependencies:

```text
npm install
```

Run eslint:

```text
npm start
```

Run jasmine test:

```text
npm test
```

{% hint style="success" %}
You can decide to open separate terminals for eslint and jasmine to keep running while you work on the CLI in another terminal.
{% endhint %}

## Boilerplate templates and demo app

Run the boilerplate templates and demo app exactly as described on the [boilerplate templates](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/node-mongo/boilerplate-templates) and the [demo CRUD app](https://code-collabo.gitbook.io/node-mongo/demo-crud-app) pages respectively.

## Project resources
